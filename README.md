## Making news posts

Posts are written as simple [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started) files, and are very easy to create.

Just follow the steps outlined [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/#creating-posts), and, if you want to upload images to
use, please upload them to the `assets/img/` directory rather than just the `assets/` one that it mentions.

## Making pages

Folders are used for drop-down names, and `.md` files are used for page names. URLs are just relative paths from the `_pages`
directory, which is where you will be creating the pages. This is very similar to making news posts.

And, for listing the page under the navigation bar, follow the general formula outlined in
[`_data/navigation.yml`](_data/navigation.yml).
